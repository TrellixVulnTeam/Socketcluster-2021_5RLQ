# sc-crud-rethink
Realtime CRUD data management layer/plugin for SocketCluster using RethinkDB as the database.

See https://github.com/socketcluster/sc-sample-inventory for a full working sample.

## Setup

See https://github.com/socketcluster/sc-sample-inventory for sample app which demonstrates this component in action.

This module is a plugin for SocketCluster, so you need to have SC installed: http://socketcluster.io/#!/docs/getting-started
Once SC is installed and you have created a new SC project, you should navigate to your project's main directory and run:

```bash
npm install sc-crud-rethink --save
```

Now you will need to attach the plugin to your worker - So open ```worker.js``` and attach it to your worker instance like this:
https://github.com/SocketCluster/sc-sample-inventory/blob/e0628b312642faa60c604a27f5eb2bfbd4231e24/worker.js#L121

As shown in the sample above, you will need to provide a schema for your data.
In the example above, the Category, Product, and User keys represent tables/models within RethinkDB - Inside each of these, you
need to declare what fields are allowed and optionally the **views** which are supported for each model type.

Simply put, a **view** is an ordered, filtered subset of all documents within a table. Views need to define a ```filter``` and/or ```order``` function
which will be used to construct the view for table's data.
