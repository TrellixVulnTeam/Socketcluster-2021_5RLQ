# sc-crud-sample

Scroll to the bottom for installation instructions.

A sample inventory tracking realtime single page app built with SocketCluster (http://socketcluster.io/), VueJS and RethinkDB.
It demonstrates a way of building realtime apps.

All code for the server-side worker logic is linked from worker.js - It's mostly generic so feel free to reuse/modify for your own app
or you can use this app as a base to build yours if starting from scratch.

Aside from SocketCluster, VueJS and RethinkDB, this sample app uses the following modules:
- sc-collection (https://github.com/SocketCluster/sc-collection - ```npm install sc-collection```)
- sc-model (https://github.com/SocketCluster/sc-model - ```npm install sc-model```)
- sc-crud-rethink (https://github.com/SocketCluster/sc-crud-rethink - ```npm install sc-crud-rethink```)

This sample app aims to demonstrate all the cutting edge features that one might want when
building a realtime single page app including:

- Authentication (via JWT tokens)
- Access control using backend middleware
- Reactive data binding
- Realtime REST-like interface
- Pagination with realtime updates

Keep in mind that this app is optimized for cutting-edgeness, not for backwards
compatibility with older browsers.

To make the most of this demo, you should open the web app in two different tabs/windows/browsers and
make updates to the data in realtime.
